Chan-Vese level-sets in Python
=============================

Numpy adaptation of the Chan-Vese level-sets code from creaseg
(http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~bernard/creaseg/). The relevant file from the
original source code is in the ``creaseg/`` folder.     
The code from Burak Bayramli
(http://ascratchpad.blogspot.com/2011/03/image-segmentation-using-active.html)
has been useful when performing this adaptation.

The Chan-Vese level sets model aims at minimizing the energy:

where I is the image, C is the boundary of the segmented region, c_1 and c_2 are
the averages of I respectively inside and outside C, and kappa is the curvature
of C.
